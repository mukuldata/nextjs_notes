### **1. Introduction to Turbopack**

1. **Turbopack** is a new Rust-based **bundler and build tool** introduced in **Next.js 14**.
2. &#x20;It is designed to be a **faster alternative** to Webpack, focusing on improving both **development speed** and **production build performance**.

🔹 **Developed by the creators of Webpack**\
🔹 **Built in Rust** (a low-level, high-performance language)\
🔹 **Optimized for large Next.js applications**

🚀 **Why does it matter?**\
Next.js projects using Webpack often experience slow builds and refresh times as they scale. Turbopack **drastically reduces build times** by **caching intelligently and compiling efficiently**.

***

### **2. Why Turbopack?**

💨 **Super-fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement)**: Instant updates without page refresh.\
📦 **Incremental Compilation**: Only re-compiles changed files instead of rebuilding everything.\
🔧 **Better Caching**: Uses Rust-based caching for quick reloads.\
🚀 **Scalability**: Handles large-scale applications much better than Webpack.

### **3. Comparison: Turbopack vs. Webpack vs. Vite**

| Feature                     | **Turbopack** (Next.js 14) | **Webpack**        | **Vite**   |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------- |
| **Language**                | Rust                       | JavaScript         | JavaScript |
| **Speed (Cold Start)**      | 🚀 Ultra-fast              | 🐢 Slow            | ⚡ Fast     |
| **Incremental Builds**      | ✅ Yes                      | ❌ No               | ✅ Yes      |
| **HMR (Hot Module Reload)** | ⚡ Super Fast               | 🐌 Slow            | 🔥 Fast    |
| **Tree Shaking**            | ✅ Optimized                | ✅ Yes              | ✅ Yes      |
| **Production Build Speed**  | 🚀 Faster                  | 🐢 Slower          | ⚡ Fast     |
| **Caching Efficiency**      | ✅ Smart caching            | ❌ Recompiles often | ✅ Good     |

👉 **Turbopack is significantly faster than Webpack and comparable to Vite but optimized for Next.js.**

### **4. How Turbopack Improves Build Performance**

**Turbopack improves performance through:**

🔹 **Incremental Compilation:** Instead of rebuilding everything, it **compiles only the changed parts**.\
🔹 **Rust-based Architecture:** Rust runs much faster than JavaScript-based Webpack.\
🔹 **Lazy Compilation:** It **compiles only what's needed** instead of the entire project.\
🔹 **Parallel Processing:** Uses **multi-threading** to process files faster.\
🔹 **Persistent Caching:** Remembers previous builds, so reloading is instant.

🚀 **Performance Boost (According to Vercel)**:

* **10x faster dev startup than Webpack**
* **4x faster HMR than Webpack**

***

### **5. Setting Up Turbopack in Next.js**

#### **Step 1: Enable Turbopack in Next.js 14**

By default, Next.js 14 still uses Webpack. To enable Turbopack, run:

```sh
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1 next dev --turbo
```

Or, modify **`package.json`**:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev --turbo"
}
```

***

### **6. Example: Using Turbopack in a Next.js App**

#### **Before (Using Webpack)**

```sh
npm run dev
```

⏳ **Takes 5-10 seconds** to start.

#### **After (Using Turbopack)**

```sh
npm run dev --turbo
```

🚀 **Starts instantly in \~1 second!**

#### **Live HMR Example**

Let's test **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** speed.

1️⃣ Start a **Next.js app**:

```sh
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev --turbo
```

2️⃣ Edit `app/page.tsx`:

```tsx
export default function Home() {
  return <h1>Hello, Next.js 14!</h1>;
}
```

3️⃣ Change **"Hello, Next.js 14!"** to **"Hello, Turbopack!"**

🔁 **With Webpack:** Takes \~3-5 seconds to refresh.\
⚡ **With Turbopack:** Changes **instantly!**

***

### **7. Limitations and Considerations**

🚧 **Turbopack is still experimental**: Some Webpack features are not fully supported.\
🚧 **Limited plugin support**: Not all Webpack plugins work with Turbopack yet.\
🚧 **Less customization**: Webpack has more configuration options.

🔹 **When should you use Turbopack?**\
✅ For faster development\
✅ For large Next.js applications\
✅ If you're facing slow Webpack builds

🔹 **When should you stick to Webpack?**\
❌ If you need advanced Webpack plugins\
❌ If you're using older Next.js versions (<13)

***

### **8. Conclusion**

✅ **Turbopack is the future of Next.js builds**\
✅ **Much faster than Webpack**\
✅ **Rust-based, optimized for speed**\
✅ **Better caching, incremental builds, and parallel processing**
